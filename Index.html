<strong>I would like to go to Oman because when I went the first time we stayed in a hotel which had everything which I wanted we also stayed
with my cousins. The only problem with to oman is that we went 
in horrible and stormy weather, the waves were so tall that it reached the restraunt and i lost my hat
because of the weather. I would l8ke to go here again with more peoplebecause of how fun it was.</strong>
